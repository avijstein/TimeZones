# TimeZones


I've thought for a while about how weird time zones are. This morning I decided I wanted to come up with a solution for it. Not a practical one, mind you. Just a solution. 

My two biggest complaints about time zones are:
* Times can be different over small distances (e.g. crossing a political boundary).
* They're not always straight lines.

The basis of this project stems from the idea that time is just a social construct (can you tell I went to a liberal arts college?). Yes, the time value (e.g. 03:45:26.223) is important for coordination, but the value is often not intrinsically important in normal life. I don't need to wake up at 06:23:45.734, I need to wake up an hour or so before work. The project aims to build a system by which our times are set by important events in our day, not by the values themselves.
